Project Information:

This program is a JavaFX application that processes spam and ham mail, and guesses which mails are spam and which are not, displaying its accuracy and precision graphically.

How to run:

It is recommended that an IDE, such as IntelliJ or Eclipse is used to run the program, but any JavaFX compatible IDE should suffice.
Upon running the program, the user will be prompted to select a directory of data to analyze.
After a directory is chosen, the program will start taking in the train and test data, and guess which files are spam.
