Project Information:

This program is a JavaFX application that processes spam and ham mail, and guesses which mails are spam and which are not, displaying its accuracy and precision graphically.
We chose to display the chosen directory to the user as an improvement, as well as making the initial screen a bit more user friendly.

How to run:

It is recommended that an IDE, such as IntelliJ or Eclipse is used to run the program, but any JavaFX compatible IDE should suffice.

The user must clone the repository into a directory on their computer, then run the Main.java file in src/sample.

Upon running the program, the user will be prompted to select a directory of data to analyze, to train using the selected data, and to view a table using the trained data. 

The user must first choose the directory of the data folder.

After a directory is chosen, they must click the button to train using the chosen directory.

The program will start taking in the train and test data, and guess which files are spam. To view the results of the programs guesses and its accuracy/precision, click the 'View Table using trained data' button.
